# Summary
This assignment was done as a test assignment for an internship.
What I loved most about this assignment is that I was genuinely 
interested in completing these tasks as they were quite challenging, yet rewarding. Implementing the scheduling interview 
feature required me to carefully consider the system's architecture and design, which allowed me to get deeper understanding 
of Springboot, APIs and DTOs. I especially enjoyed writing unit tests which helped me to ensure that the system was 
functioning correctly. Overall, I found the assignment quite challenging as my university courses have not yet covered 
all the topics. Thus, it was a great opportunity to learn and improve my coding skills.
